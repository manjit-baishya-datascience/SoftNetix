# **SoftNetix - Machine Learning Internship Projects**

Welcome to my project repository! This space showcases all the projects I've developed during my time as a **Machine Learning Intern** at **SoftNetix**.

## **Projects Overview**

### **1. `Spam Email Detector`**

I've successfully created a highly accurate Spam Email Classifier, achieving an exceptional accuracy rate. This project features an Extra Trees Classifier, rigorously trained with a well-preprocessed and cleaned dataset to ensure optimal performance even on unseen data.

### **Key Features**:
- **Robust Preprocessing**: The data underwent extensive preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, ensuring the model's ability to generalize well to new inputs.
- **High Accuracy**: The model has been fine-tuned to reach near-perfect accuracy, making it a reliable tool for detecting spam emails in various scenarios.
- **Scalability**: The classifier is designed to handle large volumes of email data, making it suitable for real-world applications.
